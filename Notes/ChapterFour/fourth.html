    Note: In case you didn't know, NSFetchRequest is a generic type.  <br>  If you inspect NSFetchRequest's initializer, you'll notice it takes in type as a parameter <ResultType : NSFetchRequestResult>.
   <br> <br>  <br>     ResultType specifies the type of objects you expect as a result of the fetch request. For example, if you're expecting an array of Venue objects, the result of the fetch request is now going to be [Venue] instead of [Any]. This is helpful because you don't have to cast down to [Venue] anymore.
