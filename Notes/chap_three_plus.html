    <p>“Note: You may be wondering how NSManagedObjectModel relates to the data model editor you’ve been using all along. Good question!
            <br> The visual editor creates and edits an xcdatamodel file. There’s a special compiler, momc, that compiles the model file into a set of files in a momd folder.
            <br>   Just as your Swift code is compiled and optimized so it can run on a device, the compiled model can be accessed efficiently at runtime. Core Data uses the compiled contents of the momd folder to initialize an NSManagedObjectModel at runtime.”
